# 3d-platformer-lol

This prototype for a 3 Dimensional Platformer was created in under a day (around 4 hours) following off of tutorials found on YouTube to create a simple, small build of what I've learned in Unity 3D. Feel free to look at my progress, this project will be completed at some point but for now its in it's early stages. Enjoy :)

(Yes you can use anything from this project if you may wish, that's the entire reason I'm hosting it here to begin with)
